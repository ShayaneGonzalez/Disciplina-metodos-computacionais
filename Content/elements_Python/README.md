# First steps in Python

## Software Carpentry lesson

Access the lesson [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
at Software Carpentry. At [Setup](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html#setup):

#### Install Python

> If you have already installed Python, go to the next topic.

#### Obtain lesson materials

> Follow the instructions given [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html#obtain-lesson-materials).

Now, start a Jupyter Notebook at the directory `swc-python`. Use the name
`topic-1.ipynb`. We will use this notebook to do the tasks of topic
[`Python Fundamentals`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/01-intro.html).
After finishing this topic, start a new notebook at the
directory `swc-python` with the name `topic-2.ipynb`. Use this notebook to
do the tasks of topic [`Analyzing Patient Data`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/02-numpy.html)
and so on. We will cover the topics 1 to 10. Topics 11 and 12 are bonus.

## Notation for vectors and Pseudo-code

After finishing the Software Carpentry lesson, take a look in the notebook `notation.ipynb`.

## Simple Moving Average (SMA)

After finishing the Software Carpentry lesson and taking a look in the notebook `notation.ipynb`,
you may be ready to understand the application of a [SMA filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Simple_moving_average) 
to a synthetic data set. The key points are:

* Create functions at external files
* Create tests with `pytest`

## Templates for functions and tests

Along the course, we will create several functions and tests. In order to keep
them readable, I have established templates. Find them in the notebook `templates.ipynb`.
